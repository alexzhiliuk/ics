                    Successful warehouse management is vital for supply chain efficiency. If even one element of a supply chain is disrupted, companies will lose money, frustrate customers and threaten their reputation. In these realities, efficient use of ERP software to streamline warehouse operations can make a big difference to a businessâ€™s bottom line.

                            One of the elements of effective warehouse management is vehicle and warehouse utilization optimization. We built [ICS] Warehouse Package to facilitate this, combining intelligent mathematical algorithms with a user-friendly interface for ease of use and optimal results. This suite of warehouse management tools, which expand upon the standard functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and D365FO, allows companies to apply the most efficient ways to load vehicles, handle inventory and plan warehouse operations. This, in turn, can help reduce shipping costs, ensure timeliness of deliveries, increase efficiency of warehouse space utilization and improve customer service.

                        <p>This suite of unique industry solutions seamlessly integrates into the Microsoft Dynamics environment, so you can start using it as quickly as possible.</p>
