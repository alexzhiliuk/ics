                        Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (formerly Dynamics AX) is one of the most advanced and comprehensive ERP products available today. But while its standard functionality may be well sufficient for a lot of companies out there, there are certain industries that rely heavily on customizations of their Dynamics system in order to overcome certain limitations of the standard version.

                        Over the years ICS team has completed many ERP implementations and customizations for customers in the logistics and production industries, and through collaboration with end-user companies we have identified some key common challenges that businesses in these sectors face in their daily operations. The result of this work is our portfolio of vertical add-on solutions that seamlessly integrate to the Dynamics 365FO or Dynamics AX 2012 R3 environment and further extend their functionality with some unique features and tools.

                        Even though our solutions were developed with logistics and production companies in mind, they will be indispensable to any business that owns a fleet of vehicles for goods transportation and/or a warehouse for their storage and uses Dynamics AX/365FO as its chosen ERP platform.
