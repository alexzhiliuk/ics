                    As businesses increasingly rely on a variety of third-party <a href="">applications</a> and services, the integration capabilities of ERP systems have become a key focus. The future of ERP will likely see an even greater emphasis on <strong>interoperability</strong> â€” the ability of ERP systems to seamlessly integrate with other software tools, platforms, and business solutions.

                        <p>One of the elements of effective warehouse management is vehicle and warehouse utilization optimization. We built [ICS] Warehouse Package to facilitate this, combining intelligent mathematical algorithms with a user-friendly interface for ease of use and optimal results. This suite of warehouse management tools, which expand upon the standard functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and D365FO, allows companies to apply the most efficient ways to load vehicles, handle inventory and plan warehouse operations. This, in turn, can help reduce shipping costs, ensure timeliness of deliveries, increase efficiency of warehouse space utilization and improve customer service.</p>
